### Project for Introduction to Programming

This project aims to represent a school system model. It sets up many classes for addresses, 
departments, students, courses and assignments, as well as a utility class for formatting names into title case.

Each class has fields and methods that represents functions of each class. Students are part of departments and have home addresses. 
The courses are in departments but also have available distinct assignments for each student. Each object is different because of their id,
making them easy to find.

Each course has a list of students that are registered to it as well as assignment lists for scores. When a student or an assignment gets
added, the list is updated, and courses calculate the student's average.

This is a simple useful tool when making a school system and calculating averages for each student.
